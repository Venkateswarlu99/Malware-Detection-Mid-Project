# Malware-Detection-API

## OVERVIEW
Welcome to the Midterm Project - Malware Detection API. This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity course (DSCI 6015) for the Spring 2024 semester at the University of New Haven, instructed by Professor Vahid Behzadan

## DESCRIPTION

One of the most important parts of computer security is malware detection. By using a machine learning model built on the EMBER 2018 dataset, this project seeks to offer a solution by categorising executable files as harmful or benign. Scalability and dependability are guaranteed in the categorization process by utilising AWS Sage Maker.

## METHODOLGY

1. Deploy the model trained for Lab 5.4 as an API endpoint on AWS SageMaker. 
2. Develop a Python client which takes in an executable file, extracts relevant features, and retrieves classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.
3. Randomly select 100 malware and 100 benign samples from EMBER 2018, and benchmark the performance of your deployed model on those samples.

## SETUP

Take these actions to duplicate the model's deployment and use:

1. First, clone the repository using git:https://github.com/Venkateswarlu99/Malware-Detection-Mid-Project.git

3. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

## USAGE

After the model is deployed, receive classification results from the Sage Maker endpoint and extract features from executable files using the Python client that comes with it.

## PERFORMANCE ASSESMENT

A test set consisting of 100 malware and 100 benign samples that were randomly picked from the EMBER 2018 dataset was utilised to assess the effectiveness of the deployed model.
