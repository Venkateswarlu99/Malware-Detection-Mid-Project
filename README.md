# Malware-Detection-API

## RECAP

An implementation for utilising AWS SageMaker to deploy a malware categorization model is hosted in this repository. The model is implemented as an API endpoint on SageMaker and trained using the EMBER 2018 dataset. Additionally, a Python client is included for obtaining classification results from the deployed endpoint and extracting features from executable files.

## OVERVIEW

One of the most important parts of computer security is malware detection. By using a machine learning model built on the EMBER 2018 dataset, this project seeks to offer a solution by categorising executable files as harmful or benign. Scalability and dependability are guaranteed in the categorization process by utilising AWS Sage Maker.

## SETUP

Take these actions to duplicate the model's deployment and use:

1. First, clone the repository using git: https://github.com/Venkateswarlu99/Malware-Detection-Mid-Project.git

3. Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the dependencies.

## USAGE

After the model is deployed, receive classification results from the Sage Maker endpoint and extract features from executable files using the Python client that comes with it.

## PERFORMANCE ASSESMENT

A test set consisting of 100 malware and 100 benign samples that were randomly picked from the EMBER 2018 dataset was utilised to assess the effectiveness of the deployed model. The classification findings are as follows:

# MALWARE ANALYSIS

• True Positives: 85

• False Negatives: 15

• Precision: 0.85

• Recall: 0.85

## BENIGN SAMPLES

• True Negatives: 90

• False Positives: 10

• Precision: 0.9

• Recall: 0.9
